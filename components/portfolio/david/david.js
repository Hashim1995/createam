  david_description:
    "In the early 1950s David Austin set out to create a more beautiful rose. Sixty years on, this simple objective remains. Rose breeding is often described as being as much an art as a science. All David Austin roses have a collective style and reflect one manâ€™s vision. All have beautiful blooms and in most cases wonderful fragrance held on graceful attractive shrubs. A garden of these outstanding roses is hard to beat for sheer exuberance of flower and fragrance.",
